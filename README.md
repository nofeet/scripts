scripts
=======

These are utility scripts I've written that I might need on a new work machine.

* periods.py: When I work independently, I like to break up my work periods into intervals. This script computes some options for that. I originally wrote it with integration with Instant Boss, a work timer in Windows.

* randint.py: Sometimes I just need a quick random integer between 1 and X inclusive. That's all this does.
